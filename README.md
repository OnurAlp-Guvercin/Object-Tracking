Object Detection Model with EfficientNetD0

This is a Python-based object detection model that uses the EfficientNetD0 architecture for image classification and object detection. 
The model can read both images and videos, and generates bounding boxes for detected objects along with the label and percentage of confidence.
Some augmentation techniques are implemented into config file of model. For more information -> stroma_object_detection.ipynb
